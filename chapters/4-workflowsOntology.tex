\chapter{Scientific Workflow Ontology}

A workflow may be defined as a collection of tasks that are executed in some
order by human and non-human actors. A workflow problem can then be defined as
any problem that is solved the the execution of a specific workflow. Many
systems exist that can execute workflows encoded in one or more
\textit{description formats} for both business and scientific problems. There
are predominantly three types of scientific workflows: High-throughput \cite{},
Modeling and Simulation \cite{}, and Analysis \cite{}.

Workflow problems of any of type can be decomposed into three required
components: The workflow description, the \textit{workflow engine} that
executes the workflow based on the description, and the data required to fully
describe and execute the workflow. The latter may include - but does not
necessarily require - metadata that describes the contents of the data itself,
bulk data including values and quantities of interest used in the workflow.
(For the purposes of this work, it is sufficient to consider provenance
information as a type of metadata.)
