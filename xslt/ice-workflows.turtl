Initialized

This pseudostate indicates that the state machine has fully initialized. In practice, full and successful initialization results in an immediate local transition to Ready.

Failed

This state indicates that an unexpected failure happened while executing the task.

Reviewing

The Reviewing state is entered when a task needs to spend a large amount of time to review information received for pre-, post-, or in-situ processing that is required to execute the task. Once the review is complete, the task will transition into the Executing state in the ideal primary flow.

Waiting

Tasks in the waiting state are waiting on resources to be properly allocated, including either compute or data resources.

WaitingForInfo

Tasks in the WaitingForInfo state are waiting on information from an external agent.

Finished

This is the terminal state for the task and indicates that it has been completely executed.

Executing

This state indicates that the task is presently executing the work assigned to it.

Ready

The ready state indicates that the task can be executed and that all initialization has completed, or that execution has finished and the task is ready to be executed again.""" ;
