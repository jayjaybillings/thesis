	\subsubsection{Action}
	This is an action that can be
			executed in a task of the workflow.
	\subsubsection{Action Type}
	This resource defines the type of the action that will
			be executed. It distinguishes between types of actions such as shell
			functions, user input, waiting, etc.
	\subsubsection{Basic Action Type}
	The Basic Action Type is the base class for basic
			actions that are typically considered native actions of workflow
			engines that execute workflows. This includes actions such as moving
			files or doing simple reductions.
	\subsubsection{Boolean Condition}
	Boolean Conditions evaluate boolean statements, such as
			"if" statements.
	\subsubsection{Common Workflow Language Tool}
	This node represents a Common Workflow Language (CWL)
			Tool, which is a description of a command line tool used in CWL
			workflows.
	\subsubsection{Condition}
	Conditional Actions Types indicate that the action
			described by this type executes for the purpose of evaluating some
			logical condition, such as a boolean statement, a loop, a cycle, or
			waiting (polling, checking) for feedback from an external agent.
	\subsubsection{Conditional Action}
	Conditional Actions are actions that execute
			conditionally for either conditional tasks (i.e. - as part of the
			workflow) or as alternative execution flows when the task enters a
			different state.
			Conditional actions assigned to tasks indicate that the primary action of the
			task should be executed according to the conditional action type
			until the condition action evaluates to true.
	\subsubsection{Cycle}
	A Cycle describes an action that exits when a condition
			describing the end of a cycle has been met. Where a loop action type
			describes execution over a range, a cyclic action type checks for the
			completion of a task cycle.
	\subsubsection{Generic Executable}
	The Executable Action Type is the base class for actions
			that require executing generic programs on the system.
	\subsubsection{External Agent Condition}
	The External Agent Condition describes an action that
			waits conditionally on feedback from an external agent, including a
			human or an external service. Tasks can block themselves to wait on
			feedback, but in some cases an explicit task may exist for a user can
			that can be described and explicitly executed in the workflow.
	\subsubsection{Fortran Function}
	The Fortran Function Action Type is the base class for
			actions that require executing a function in the Fortran programming
			language.
	\subsubsection{Java Class}
	The Java Class Action Type is the base class for actions
			that require executing a class in the Java programming language.
			Action Targets for this type should point to a single method in the
			class that will create all necessary state and configure the system
			before executing. Thus, to execute a class Car, it may make sense to
			call a builder class such as "CarBuilder.runCar" instead.
	\subsubsection{Language Invocation}
	This action type represents actions to invocation
			language-specific calls or executions as part of the workflow. This
			could include, for example, executing a method on a native Java
			class, or a Fortran function or subroutine, or an R function.
	\subsubsection{Loop}
	The Loop describes an action that exits when a condition
			describing the end of a loop has been met. The loop executes over a
			range, and differs from a cyclic action type because the latter
			checks for the completion of a task cycle.
	\subsubsection{Parallel Loop}
	A Parallel Loop Condition indicates that the loop may be
			executed in parallel (i.e. - that the iterations of the loop are
			independent).
	\subsubsection{Python Script}
	The Python Script Action Type is the base class for
			actions that require executing a script in the Python programming
			language.
	\subsubsection{RESTful Web Service}
	This action types describes Representational State
			Transfer (RESTful) web services.
	\subsubsection{SOAP Web Service}
	This action types describes Simple Object Access
			Protocol (SOAP) web services.
	\subsubsection{Shell Script}
	The Shell Script action type is for actions that require
			executing shell scripts on systems that support shells.
	\subsubsection{State Change}
	A State Change is executed under the condition that a
			task experiences a state change.
	\subsubsection{Task}
	Tasks are executed by workflows. They are modeled as the
			combination of an action and properties defining the way that action
			should be executed.
			Tasks may also be assigned conditional actions that evaluate when a
			certain condition has been met based on the execution of the primary
			action with its properties.
	\subsubsection{WSDL Web Service}
	This action types describes Web Service Description
			Language (WSDL) web services.
	\subsubsection{Web Service}
	The Web Service Action Type is the base class for
			actions that require executing remote web services.
	\subsubsection{Workflow Description}
	This class provides a description
			of the data and tasks that make up a workflow. It describes a
			collections of tasks that are executed to accomplish an activity with
			certain goals according to various properties and possibly using some
			data.
