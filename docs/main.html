<!--l. 3--><p class="noindent" >The study of workflows, workflow management systems, and the broader topics of
so-called &#8220;workflow science&#8221; has revolutionized the way humans automate activities
in business, science, medicine and many others fields, greatly improving efficiency in
each. Our dependence on workflow tools and technology is so great that some of the
most common questions in technical discussions are arguably &#8220;How do we automate
that?&#8221; and &#8220;How are you going to handle your workflow?&#8221; Workflow tools have
even &#8220;invaded&#8221; our homes by becoming so easy to use that children can
use them to clandestinely stock up on cookies, doll houses, and Pokemon,
<span class="cite">[<a 
href="#X_6-year-old_2016">1</a>]</span><span class="cite">[<a 
href="#Xwilliams_6-year-old_2017">2</a>]</span>!
<!--l. 14--><p class="indent" >   However, there are many unresolved problems in workflow science that will
seriously limit the continued utility of these tools for interdisciplinary research. There
are many practical problems, some of which are shared with other fields, but the
largest issues are those of a fundamental, theoretical nature that have never been
investigated across the entire field. For example, what is a &#8220;workflow&#8221; and what is a
&#8220;workflow management system?&#8221; Are workflows in modeling and simulation the same
as workflows in grid computing? Are scientific workflows actually the same as
business workflows given the right theoretical abstraction? There are no generally
accepted answers for these questions and, indeed, every relevant reference for this
work provided a different definition of a workflow, (albeit some of the definitions were
similar).
<!--l. 28--><p class="indent" >   These basic, fundamental questions have significant implications for long-term
sustainability, interoperability, and (workflow) reproducibility. Interoperability in
particular is interesting because of the opportunity to leverage existing capabilities
and workflows in different systems without reproducing either the components or
the workflows in the second system. In practice, this is rarely possible. Few
workflow systems will work together because most systems are developed with
different or custom approaches, or, in many cases, were never developed
to be interoperable at all and there are no obvious ways to &#8220;just make it
work.&#8221;
<!--l. 39--><p class="indent" >   In this work, we propose that the solution to these problems stems from the lack
of a comprehensive ontology for workflow science. Specifically, we
     <ul class="itemize1">
     <li class="itemize">provide  a  brief  literature  review  of  workflows  and  efforts  to  develop
     taxonomies  (not  ontologies)  for  workflows  and  workflow  management
     systems, and describe why a classic taxonomy may be insufficient.
     </li>
     <li class="itemize">present  the  Eclipse  Integrated  Computational  Environment  as  an
     appropriate test bed for these ideas and contextualize it in the broader
     workflows tool space.
     </li>
     <li class="itemize">describe  challenges  the  workflows  community  is  currently  facing  that
     would  be  solved  by  the  development  of  an  ontology  that  facilitated
     interoperability.
     </li>
                                                                  

                                                                  
     <li class="itemize">enummerate the necessary tasks and challenges of such an effort.</li></ul>

   <h3 class="sectionHead"><span class="titlemark">2.1   </span> <a 
 id="x1-30002.1"></a>Workflows</h3>
<!--l. 5--><p class="noindent" >As mentioned previously, one of the most challenging aspects of studying workflows is
the way the vocabulary has been overloaded unintentionally. It is somewhat clearer
to understand them by considering the historial perspective.
<!--l. 10--><p class="indent" >   The use and study of workflows and the initial implementation of workflow
management systems developed in the business world with the need to automate
business processes. Ludï¿½scher et al. ascribe the origins of workflows and workflow
management systems to &#8220;office automation&#8221; trends in the 1970s, <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#Xludascher_scientific_2006">3</a>]</span>. Van Der Aalst
argues that &#8220;workflows&#8221; arose from the needs of businesses to not only execute tasks,
but &#8220;to manage the flow of work through the organization,&#8221; and that managing
workflows is the natural evolution from the monolithic applications of the 1960s to
applications that rely on external functionality in the 1990s, <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#Xvan_der_aalst_application_1998">4</a>]</span>. (One might
argue that Van Der Aalst&#8217;s depiction continues today with the growth of the
&#8220;microservices&#8221; architectural movement.) By 1995, in the presence of many workflow
tools, the Workflow Management Coalition had developed a &#8220;standard&#8221; definition of
workflows, <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#Xhollingsworth_workflow_1993">5</a>]</span>,
<!--l. 26--><p class="indent" >
     <!--l. 26--><p class="noindent" >A Workflow is the automation of a business process, in whole or part,
     during which documents, information or tasks are passed from one
     participant (a resource; human or machine) to another for action,
     according a set of procedural rules.
<!--l. 32--><p class="indent" >   In the early 2000s, workflow systems started finding use in scientific contexts
where process automation was required for scientific uses instead of traditional
business uses. The focus of scientific workflows, at the time, also shifted to focus
primarily on data processing for large &#8220;grids&#8221; of networked services, <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#Xyu_taxonomy_2005">6</a>]</span>. Yu and
Buyya define a workflow as
<!--l. 40--><p class="indent" >
     <!--l. 40--><p class="noindent" >... a collection of tasks that are processed on distributed resources
     in a well-defined order to accomplish a specific goal.
<!--l. 44--><p class="indent" >   This definition is important because of what is missing: the human element. For
many in the scientific workflows community this has become the standard
definition of a workflow and the involvement of humans results not in a single
workflow, but two workflows spanned by a human. Machines or instruments are
absent from the definition as well, but in practice many modern scientific
workflows are launched automatically when data &#8220;comes off&#8221; of instruments
because they remain the primary source of data in grid workflows, (c.f. -
<span class="cite">[<a 
href="#Xmegino_panda:_2015">7</a>]</span>).
                                                                  

                                                                  
<!--l. 53--><p class="indent" >   In addition to &#8220;grid workflows,&#8221; the scientific community started exploring
&#8220;modeling and simulation&#8221; workflows which focus not on data flow, but on the
orchestration of activities related to modeling and simulation instead, sometimes on
small local computers, but often on the largest of the world&#8217;s &#8220;Leadership Class&#8221;
supercomputers. These workflows typically fall into a subset of their more general
cousins that can be found in the grid or business communities, but unlike grid
workflows they tend to require human interaction in one way or another. Some of
these workflows are defined in the context of a particular way of working, such as the
Automation, Data, Environment, and Sharing (ADES) model of Pizzi et al., <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#Xpizzi_aiida:_2016">8</a>]</span>, the
&#8220;Design-to-Analysis&#8221; model of Clay et al., <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#Xclay_incorporating_2015">9</a>]</span>, or the model of Billings et al.
presented later in this work during the discussion on the Eclipse Integrated
Computational Environment. However, many scientific workflows, while
exceptionally well defined, remain hard coded into dedicated environments
developed for the sole purpose of executing that single or at most a few related
workflows.
<!--l. 71--><p class="indent" >   Additional types of workflows in the scientific community include workflows that
process ensembles of calculations, <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#Xmontoya_apex_2016">10</a>]</span>, and workflows that are used for testing
software.
<!--l. 76--><p class="noindent" >
   <h3 class="sectionHead"><span class="titlemark">2.2   </span> <a 
 id="x1-40002.2"></a>Taxonomies and Classification</h3>
<!--l. 78--><p class="noindent" >There have been several efforts to classify, survey or develop taxonomies for
workflows. Yu and Buyya are the only source that provides what can be truly
considered a &#8220;taxonomy,&#8221; by showing the hierarchical relationships between workflow
concepts. Most of the other efforts discussed below, while claiming to produce
taxonomies, in fact produce controlled vocabularies.
<!--l. 85--><p class="indent" >   Human involvement is critical in some workflows which require adaptive
management, as shown by Han and Bussler, <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#Xhan_taxonomy_1998">11</a>]</span>. Their work considers adaptive
workflow management in the context of healthcare workflows and argues that
workflow technology in 2002 was incapable of adapting sufficiently to meet the
unexpected needs of medical personnel. Along with unexpected needs (&#8220;changing
environment&#8221;), they cite the evolution of software systems (&#8220;technical advances&#8221;) as
another critical area that leads to required changes in workflow management
systems.
<!--l. 95--><p class="indent" >   Han and Bussler discuss situations that lead to &#8220;ad-hoc derivation&#8221; of workflows.
&#8220;Ad-hoc derivation&#8221; in this case means generating extra workflow steps or details,
such as converting from an abstract to a concrete workflow as Pegasus and other grid
workflow systems do. Specifically, Han and Bussler cite dynamic refinement, user
involvement, unpredictable events and erroneous situations as systems that
require the workflow to behave in an unplanned way, and for which workflow
managements systems should be prepared. Meta-models, open-point (more
commonly known as &#8220;extension point&#8221;) or hybrid approaches are proposed as
solutions.
<!--l. 106--><p class="indent" >   It is important to note that Han and Bussler consider only business workflows and
                                                                  

                                                                  
management systems, not scientific workflows and management systems. In this
context they also share some important wisdom that is, arguably, of equal
importance to scientific workflows:
<!--l. 112--><p class="indent" >
     <!--l. 112--><p class="noindent" >Workflow systems do not exist for their own purposes. They are a
     constituent component of a business system. A business system is
     usually domain specific.
<!--l. 117--><p class="indent" >   This is an important consideration for scientific workflows because the &#8220;business
logic&#8221; of scientific workflows is &#8220;domain logic&#8221; that is highly specific to the scientific
domain under consideration. This necessarily leads to a diverse ecosystem of workflow
systems.
<!--l. 122--><p class="indent" >   Yu and Buyya developed a taxonomy for workflow management systems on grids
that sought to capture the architectural style while identifying comparison criteria,
<span class="cite">[<a 
href="#Xyu_taxonomy_2005">6</a>]</span>. Their work is notable because it largely avoids a discussion of applications and
focuses purely on the functional properties of the workflow management systems as
they exist on the grids. Yu and Buyya root their taxonomy on five core elements of
grid-based workflow management systems: workflow design, information retrieval,
workflow scheduling, fault tolerance, and data movement. While many of the
properties and taxonomic elements they describe seem common to all systems, others
would appear to be grid-specific at present, such as &#8220;Workflow QoS Constraints&#8221;.
Their work also shows how thirteen common grid workflow management
systems, including Pegasus and Kepler, are covered by the taxonomy. Like
other authors, Yu and Buyya cite the lack of standardized workflow syntax
and language as sources of interoperability issues. Yu&#8217;s and Buyya&#8217;s work
is extremely detailed and a very helpful resource for understanding grid
workflows.
<!--l. 139--><p class="indent" >   Scientific workflow management systems have flourished since their inception,
although not without significant overlap and duplication of effort. The survey of
scientific workflow management systems by Barker and Hemert illustrates both
the growth and problems while also providing important observations and
recommendations on the topic, <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#Xbarker_scientific_2007">12</a>]</span>.
<!--l. 146--><p class="indent" >   Barker and Hemert also provide key insights into the history of workflow
management systems as an important part of business automation. The authors
make an important comparison between traditional business workflow management
systems and their scientific counterparts, citing in particular that traditional business
workflow tools employ the wrong abstraction for scientists They define workflows
using the &#8220;standard&#8221; definition from the Workflow Management Coalition, previously
mentioned above.
<!--l. 155--><p class="indent" >   The discussion points that Barker and Hemert raise are important because of
their continuing importance and relevance today, particularly the need to enable
programmability through standard languages instead of custom, proprietary
languages. (The reader is encouraged to read the entire paper for more details.)
                                                                  

                                                                  
Sticking to standards is also important and perhaps illustrated best by Barker&#8217;s and
Hemert&#8217;s statement that
<!--l. 164--><p class="indent" >
     <!--l. 164--><p class="noindent" >If  software  development  and  tool  support  terminates  on  one
     proprietary framework, workflows will need to be re-implemented
     from scratch.
<!--l. 168--><p class="indent" >   This is an important point even for workflow tools that do not use proprietary
standards, but &#8220;roll their own&#8221; solutions. What can be done to support those tools
and reproduce those workflows once support for continued development
ends?
<!--l. 173--><p class="indent" >   Notably, in their discussion about the Kepler workflow management system,
Barker and Hemert state that
<!--l. 177--><p class="indent" >
     <!--l. 177--><p class="noindent" >Actors are re-usable independent blocks of computation, such as:
     Web Services, database calls, etc.
<!--l. 181--><p class="indent" >   Jha and Turilli have proposed using independent &#8220;building blocks&#8221; as an
approach to scientific workflows which espouses a similar relationship to
infrastructure services, <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#Xjha_building_2016">13</a>]</span>. The similarity is notable and the exact relationship
between Jha&#8217;s blocks and Actor-Oriented Programming merit further investigation.
Jha and Turilli provide an ambiguous definition of workflows, stating that workflows
are both comprised of tasks and provide a description of the resources and
constraints for each task. The ambiguity rises from the definition of &#8220;tasks.&#8221; If tasks
are compute processes, then their definition is equivalent to that of grid workflows.
However, if a task could include human interaction during execution, then they
have a much broader definition than what is normally found in the grid
literature, and their definition more closely resembles a business workflow.
Building blocks, on the other hand, are concretely defined as those pieces of
middleware that are self-sufficient, interoperable, composable, and extensible, (with
detailed definitions of each provided). The RADICAL-Cybertools suite of
software modules from Jha&#8217;s group is presented as a sample set of building
blocks and two case studies where these tools were successfully as such are
presented.
<!--l. 201--><p class="indent" >   Montoya et al. discuss workflows needs for the Alliance for Application
Performance at Extreme Scale (APEX), <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#Xnersc_apex_2016">14</a>]</span>, and describe three main classes of
workflows: Simulation Science, Uncertainty Quantification (UQ), and High
Throughput Computing (HTC), <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#Xmontoya_apex_2016">10</a>]</span>. HTC workflows start with the collection of data
from experiments that is in turn transported to large compute facilities for
processing. Many grid workflows are HTC workflows, but not all HTC workflows are
grid workflows since some HTC workflows, such as those those presented by Montoya
                                                                  

                                                                  
et al., maybe be run on large resources that are not traditionally &#8220;grid machines.&#8221;
Simulation science workflows, referred to above as modeling and simulation
workflows, are those workflows that are primarily focused on modeling and
simulation activities. UQ workflows build on modeling and simulation workflows by
executing ensembles of jobs or ensembles of whole workflows to quantify
uncertainty in simulation results. Montoya et al. also provide a detailed
mapping of each workflow type to optimal hardware resources for the APEX
program.

application types: Simulations, Instruments, and Collaborations. The findings of the

priorities in Application Requirements, Hardware Systems, System Software, WMS

collection of managed processes, which is common, but in such a way that
it is clear that reproducibility, mobility and some degree of generality are
required by both the description of the workflow and the management system.

<!--l. 239--><p class="indent" >   The brief summary of different workflow models above is a sample of the

applications of the Eclipse Integrated Computational Environment. This model limits
its scope to high-performance computing (HPC) and to the set of possible workflows

modifying code. However, as &#8220;limited&#8221; as ICE&#8217;s model may be, it shows significant
ability to interoperate with other workflow engines. This and other qualities of the
system are why it is revisited later as a proposed platform for testing an
interoperability layer.

<!--l. 3--><p class="noindent" >Problems in modeling and simulation require significantly different workflow
management technologies than standard grid-based workflow management systems.
Computational scientists typically interact with simulation software in a
feedback driven way were solutions and workflows are developed iteratively and
simultaneously. This work describes common activities in workflows and how
combinations of these activities form unique workflows. It presents the Eclipse
Integrated Computational Environment as a workflow management system and
development environment for the modeling and simulation community. Examples of
the Environment&#8217;s applicability to problems in energy science, general multiphysics
simulations, quantum computing and other areas are presented as well as its impact
on the community.
   <h3 class="sectionHead"><span class="titlemark">3.1   </span> <a 
 id="x1-60003.1"></a>Motivation and Significance</h3>
<!--l. 18--><p class="noindent" >High performance modeling and simulation software is hard to use. Much of the
challenge comes from the inherent nature of the science under consideration, but
perhaps just as much of the problem comes from focusing very heavily on raw
compute performance. Focusing on performance is understandable, given the field,
but producing highly usable software is advantageous for a variety of reasons as well,
especially when enabling novices or users who migrate between codes often to address
new scientific questions.
<!--l. 27--><p class="indent" >   In previous work, Billings et. al., discovered through requirements gathering
interviews that many of the difficulties using high performance modeling and
simulation software fall broadly into five distinct categories, <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#Xbillings_designing_2009">16</a>]</span>. These activities,
detailed in section <a 
href="#x1-70003.1.1">3.1.1<!--tex4ht:ref: workflow-model --></a>, creating input, executing jobs, analyzing results, managing
data, and modifying code. There are many tools that address these problems
individually, but the same work found that the excess number and specialization of
these tools also contribute to the learning curve.
<!--l. 37--><p class="indent" >   Efforts to address these five issues typically fall in with general purpose scientific
workflow tools like Kepler, <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#Xludascher_scientific_2006">3</a>]</span>, or are reduced to myopic tools that satisfy some set of
requirements for a single piece of software or platform. These are opposing extremes,
but a middle-of-the-road solution is also possible. A workflow engine could be
developed that limits its scope to High-Performance Computing (HPC) and to the
set of possible workflows that come from the previously mentioned five activities. A
rich enough Application Programming Interface (API) could be exposed so
that highly customized solutions could still be made based on this limited
workflow engine with only a relatively minor amount of additional development
required.
<!--l. 49--><p class="indent" >   It is not clear that one of these solutions is better than the others. Practical
requirements will ultimately dictate which way projects go. This work considers a
middle ground solution and presents the Eclipse Integrated Computational
Environment (ICE) as proof that it is possible to create such a system. Specifically,
we show
     <ul class="itemize1">
     <li class="itemize">that modeling and simulation activities can be described in a succinct

<!--l. 74--><p class="noindent" >Computational scientists perform a variety of tasks with respect to modeling and
simulation that can be abstracted into a lightweight theoretical framework broadly
based on five high-level <span 
class="cmti-10">activities</span>: creating input, executing jobs, analyzing results,
managing data, and modifying code. The same computational scientist would most
likely find these activities difficult for all codes with which they lack experience,
whereas with their own codes or those with which they are most familiar these tasks
may be so easy that they are taken for granted. Any particular combination
of these activities across one or more scientific software packages or codes
results in a unique <span 
class="cmti-10">workflow</span>. Such a workflow is normally, but not always,
requested by a human user and orchestrated by a <span 
class="cmti-10">Workflow Management System</span>
<span 
class="cmti-10">(WMS)</span>.
<!--l. 88--><p class="indent" >   The most obvious workflow for any individual simulation code or collection of
codes is to string the activities together: the user&#8217;s workflow is to create the input,
launch the job, perform some analysis and manage their data, possibly modifying
their code in the process. There are many other combinations though, such as
re-running jobs with conditions or modifications or analyzing someone else&#8217;s
data.<span class="footnote-mark"><a

 id="x1-7001f1"></a> 
<!--l. 98--><p class="indent" >   <span 
class="cmbx-10">Creating input </span>is the process of describing the physical model or state of a
system that will be simulated. This could include creating an input file or file(s),
but could also include external calls to a process to configure a running
program. In most situations a computational scientist will modify existing input
or create new input from a template. &#8220;Input&#8221; generally includes runtime
                                                                  

                                                                  
parameters for the simulation framework (tolerances, etc.); configuration
options (data locations, output locations, module configurations, etc.); material
properties for the materials that will be simulated; and a discretization of the
simulation space (mesh, grid, particle distribution, etc.). The collection of all
required input can be quite large and may go by many names such as &#8220;input
set,&#8221; &#8220;input package,&#8221; &#8220;problem,&#8221; or, simply, &#8220;input.&#8221; Often the set of input
files will be described in a &#8220;main&#8221; input file that acts as a kind of manifest,
describing and providing links to all necessary information for the given
problem.
<!--l. 115--><p class="indent" >   In this work, it should be assumed unless otherwise noted that &#8220;input&#8221; refers to
the entire set of input, not a single file.
<!--l. 118--><p class="indent" >   <span 
class="cmbx-10">Executing jobs </span>or &#8220;running the workflow&#8221; in this context is the process of
performing some calculation based on the input with a simulation code or framework.
Modeling and simulation codes are normally run locally for small jobs or
development. Large simulations typically require equally large hardware resources
that are utilized remotely through Secure Shell (SSH) connections or similar
protocols. Remote execution requires moving the input in advance of the execution
and copying or moving the output to the user&#8217;s machine, if possible and
desirable. (In many cases the output cannot be moved because it is too
large.)
<!--l. 129--><p class="indent" >   Local and remote jobs are often monitored in one or more ways to ascertain the
status of job. This can include simply checking whether or not execution has finished
or monitoring the output of individual quantities to examine the calculation state.
The latter is often used to detect calculation errors that will result in incorrect
results. If such results are found, the job is typically cancelled (&#8220;killed&#8221;) to save
compute resources and re-run later.
<!--l. 137--><p class="indent" >   In this work, it should be assumed unless otherwise noted that &#8220;executing a job&#8221;
includes monitoring that job in one or more ways, possibly including real-time
updates to visualizations.
<!--l. 141--><p class="indent" >   <span 
class="cmbx-10">Analyzing results </span>includes executing special jobs to transform data in one or
more prescribed ways and producing artifacts with scientific significance from the
transformed data. This may include, for example, post-processing results and
visualizing the new data with dedicated visualization tools. For many types of
scientific computing this includes viewing the results of a simulation on a mesh or
grid and extracting publication quality images or movies from that data. Other cases
may include analyzing results in preparation for follow simulations or performing
feature extraction, classification or activities for machine learning and data
mining.
<!--l. 152--><p class="indent" >   While this has many similarities to executing a job, it is distinctly different
because the activity changes focus to satisfy the needs of a human operator. Simple
data reduction where the exact reduction is known certainly qualifies as executing a
job, but analysis of modeling and simulation results is far from simple data
reduction. It is generally a far more interactive process for computational
scientists.
<!--l. 159--><p class="indent" >   <span 
class="cmbx-10">Managing data </span>includes moving, copying, storing, sharing or otherwise
interacting with data for or from simulations. This activity is the most pervasive of
                                                                  

                                                                  
all the activities because each of the others requires interacting with data in some
way. In many cases though, data is still managed its own purposes, without
performing a simulation, generating new input, or analysing results. Examples
include archiving data, packaging data for publications, and updating values
manually (often in light of new information from publications).
<!--l. 168--><p class="indent" >   <span 
class="cmbx-10">Modifying code </span>is not typically considered a part of a scientific computing
workflow. However, modeling and simulation use cases often require users to
explicitly modify code before execution, such as with the computational fluid
dynamics code Nek5000, <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#Xthe_nek5000_team_nek5000_2014">17</a>]</span>; or to issue special re-build instructions. Many
computational scientists consider &#8220;their workflow&#8221; to be re-running software after
modifications for purely exploratory purposes. This may be required if the model the
author is manipulating can not be configured as part of the input directly but can be
easily manipulated by hand.
   <h5 class="subsubsectionHead"><a 
 id="x1-80003.1.1"></a>Comparison to Other Models</h5>
<!--l. 182--><p class="noindent" >This model of workflows differs significantly from those of similar efforts in workflow
science because it defines workflows in terms of activities. Others in the literature
define a workflow as a collection of computing processes. For example, Yu and Buyya
define grid workflows as &#8220;a collection of tasks that are processed on distributed
resources in a wel-defined order to accomplish a specific goal,&#8221; <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#Xyu_taxonomy_2005">6</a>]</span>. Others such as
Pizzi et al. subscribe to similar definitions, <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#Xpizzi_aiida:_2016">8</a>]</span>. This &#8220;process&#8221; view is acceptable
where the workflow is static and does not require additional human input or &#8220;human
in the loop&#8221; behavior after the all the initial human input is provided. That
is, a &#8220;process-oriented&#8221; definition is acceptable where all human input is
provided in advance. However, workflows within ICE are fully interactive with
regular call-backs to humans. It is simpler to discuss &#8220;activities&#8221; than it is to
create a distinction between &#8220;human processes&#8221; and &#8220;computer processes.&#8221;
Focusing on &#8220;activities&#8221; over processes (human or computer) also has the
benefit of removing concrete elements such as hardware properties or software
details that distract from details of workflows and WMSes per se. That is,
considerations such as memory usage and raw performance are important, but
questions about the abstract workflow or what the WMS should do are far more
important.

<!--l. 204--><p class="noindent" >ICE was specifically created to address the workflow model described above, which is
to say that it was created specifically to address hands-on workflows for
computational scientists. Users download and execute ICE locally and it orchestrates
workflows locally or remotely as required. It provides a comprehensive workbench for
modeling and simulation that includes tools for workflows, visualization, data
management, and software development.

 id="x1-100003.2.1"></a>Software Architecture</h4>
<!--l. 214--><p class="noindent" >Workflows and tasks in ICE are not explicitly treated as trees - Directed Acyclic
Graphs, (DAGS) - as is common with grid workflow tools, <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#Xyu_taxonomy_2005">6</a>]</span>. Instead, ICE&#8217;s design
is inspired by Representational State Transfer (REST), <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#Xfielding_architectural_2000">18</a>]</span>.
<!--l. 219--><p class="indent" >   Users initiate requests to create, edit, update or delete workflows from the <span 
class="cmti-10">ICE</span>
<span 
class="cmti-10">Client </span>(the workbench). The list of available workflow that can be created is
provided dynamically to the <span 
class="cmti-10">ICE Client </span>by the <span 
class="cmti-10">ICE Core</span>, which acts as a kind
of server. This information is provided dynamically since it often changes
as run time based on the configuration of available workflow components
in the registry and on persisted workflows that users have saved in their
workspace. Information about workflows are provided from the Core to the
Client through <span 
class="cmti-10">stateless Forms </span>that describe the workflow and provide all the
necessary information to understand <span 
class="cmti-10">what </span>should process the workflow, (but
not <span 
class="cmti-10">how </span>it should be processed). Once users modify the description of the
workflow in the Form to provide their specific details, the Client dispatches a
request to the Core to modify or process the workflow. The Core then uses the
information in the Form to perform a service lookup for <span 
class="cmti-10">what </span>should process the
workflow.
<!--l. 235--><p class="indent" >   Workflows in ICE are encoded in and processed by <span 
class="cmti-10">Items </span>and each workflow type
is a subclass of Item. Items are registered dynamically through a service registry in
ICE, (see section <span 
class="cmbx-10">??</span>), and provide the Forms for the ICE Core and Client. Since
ICE&#8217;s design is highly object oriented, it is easiest to think of the Item class as a
description of an abstract workflow and an Item object (an instance of the class)
as a concrete workflow with all required execution details provided by its
Form.
<!--l. 244--><p class="indent" >   Individual components of workflows, i.e. - workflow &#8220;tasks&#8221; or &#8220;nodes&#8221; - are

<span

<!--l. 269--><p class="indent" >   In addition to running as a desktop workbench, ICE can be run as a headless web
server with a remote service interface and a web Application Programming Interface
(API). The web API is also used as the primary means of providing real-time
feedback and monitoring support in ICE.
   <h5 class="subsubsectionHead"><a 
 id="x1-110003.2.1"></a>Item States</h5>
<!--l. 277--><p class="noindent" >All Items in ICE are finite state machines where the states represent the abstract
state of the workflow. For example, when an Item is first created, it enters the &#8220;Form
Ready&#8221; state to indicate that it could, in theory, be processed after a user reviews it.
After that review it enters the &#8220;Ready to Process&#8221; state before and the
&#8220;Processed&#8221; state after it is processed. There are several additional states for
errors.
<!--l. 284--><p class="indent" >   This design is very important. First, it means that all workflows in ICE,
regardless of their actual details and function, can only behave in a specific set
of known, predictable ways. This greatly simplifies the way that the Core
manages and interacts with Items. Second, it explicitly delineates which
workflows can be executed from those that must still receive some configuration
because it formalizes state and error checks. Finally, it allows developers
implementing Items and Actions to specify by contract what is required before
proceeding to the next task, processing the workflow, or declaring a successful
execution.
<!--l. 295--><p class="noindent" >
   <h5 class="subsubsectionHead"><a 
 id="x1-120003.2.1"></a>Persistence and Workspaces</h5>
<!--l. 297--><p class="noindent" >ICE persists permanent copies of Forms to disk when workflows are created and
modified in a special directory called a <span 
class="cmti-10">workspace</span>. Workspaces can contain projects,
folders and files, including data, code, input and output. ICE automatically manages
local and remote (or even local <span 
class="cmti-10">to </span>remote) transfers of data files when executing
workflows if the files are detected in the same directory of the workspace as the
workflow itself. For example, when executing a remote job, ICE will automatically
move the input file if it is specified in the workflow and available in the project
directory of the workspace. Likewise, if output is small enough, ICE will
automatically move it back to local directory. By conventional, all paths in ICE&#8217;s
Forms are relative to the workspace root path. Workspace directories are specified by
the user.
<!--l. 311--><p class="indent" >   ICE handles persistence using a <span 
class="cmti-10">persistence provider</span>. The only default
persistence provider uses JAX-RS, <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#Xburke_restful_2010">19</a>]</span>, to write Forms to XML. In principle other
persistence providers could replace the XML-based provider since it is registered
as a dynamic service, and in the past a JAX-P based provider has been
used.

 id="x1-130003.2.1"></a>Extending the Framework to Add Custom Workflows</h5>
<!--l. 320--><p class="noindent" >ICE is an Eclipse Rich Client Platform (RCP) application, <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#Xmcaffer_eclipse_2010">20</a>]</span>. It has a plugin
architecture based on Equinox, the reference implementation of the Open Service
Gateway Initiative (OSGi) framework specification, <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#Xmcaffer_osgi_2010">21</a>]</span>. It uses over 1200 additional
packages from the Eclipse ecosystem to provide services such as language support
and visualization to users. Each unique element of ICE described in this work,
including the client, core, all Items, data structures and many others are provided as
plugins to Equinox. Most plugins are dynamically managed and provided as services
that can be obtained from a service registry. All file I/O in ICE, with only a
few exceptions, interacts with the RCP&#8217;s Resources plugin. This includes
remote resources that are managed with the Eclipse Parallel Tools Platform,
<span class="cite">[<a 
href="#Xtibbitts_integrated_2009">22</a>]</span>.
<!--l. 333--><p class="indent" >   It is not possible to graphically create new Items in ICE. Users can only use the
workflow Items provided with their version of ICE unless they provide their own
plugin to the framework. This can seem like an onerous task to the novice user
especially if they do not know Java, but this design was chosen because it is, in the
opinion of the authors, a far more sophisticated and sustainable way to create
workflows than through wiring diagram.
<!--l. 341--><p class="indent" >   ICE provides built-in development tools to auto-generate &#8220;stubs&#8221; of plugins that
can then be installed into the framework. This &#8220;self-hosting&#8221; makes it possible for
new users to create complex, sophisticated workflows very quickly because they are
not required to know how to interact with the framework. Furthermore, ICE
provides a rich API, documentation, tutorials, and tools to further simply the
process.
<!--l. 349--><p class="indent" >   There are many situations where graphically configuring workflows is
unacceptable, such as when a very large number of workflows will be executed or the
type of information required is very fine-grained. In these cases, it is often necessary
to provide scripts to the workflow management system. ICE includes the Eclipse
Advanced Scripting Environment, <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#Xpontesegger_eclipse_2015">23</a>]</span>, (EASE), for scripting because it provides a
native way to script Eclipse RCP projects in Javascript, Jython, and Python. This
also makes it possible to extend the environment by adding Items in these
languages.

<!--l. 361--><p class="noindent" >The most important function of ICE is to serve as an easily extended workflow
management system for computational scientists in support of the activities
described above. In practice, it is most often used as a combination of workflow
management system and development environment since it contains a significant
amount of Eclipse&#8217;s software development tooling in addition to the workflow tools.
The project has many users, but it is most heavily used by the development team to
support workflow science and software development for energy science projects. The
development team regularly uses the platform to quickly deploy new domain-specific

<!--l. 444--><p class="noindent" >Solid-state sintering of parts printed using binder jetting significantly increases
part strength by decreasing the part porosity and eliminating voids. The
downside of this process is that it causes the part to shrink and warp. An
ideal near-net-shape process that combined binder jetting with solid-state
sintering would thus consider warpage and deformation due to sintering
in the design phase of the part. Figure 3 shows an ICE-based workbench
for perform simulations of this process with visualizations of the pre- and
post-simulation properties of a central body with eight cantilevers. The primary
deformation in this type of geometry is bending or drooping of the cantilevers,
and ICE currently calls a custom MOOSE-based application (which was
written in ICE as described above) for simulating the deformation of the
cantilevers.

<!--l. 515--><p class="noindent" >The impact of software tools such as ICE are hard to quantify. However, there are
several places where ICE has significantly assisted its development team and
others.
<!--l. 519--><p class="indent" >   One pressing area of interest and impact is that of interoperability between
workflow systems. There is significant prior art in combining large workflow
management systems, such as that Mandal et al., <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#Xmandal_integrating_2007">32</a>]</span>, but the end goal of gaining the
greatest advantage by using the best capabilities from multiple systems remains
elusive. ICE&#8217;s unique perspective on workflows and its well-defined API make it
possible to integrate multiple systems in a straightforward way. This allows it to
connect to other workflow environments, such as Triquetrum, quite easily,
<span class="cite">[<a 
href="#Xbrooks_introducing_2016">33</a>]</span>. Triquetrum, (like Kepler in <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#Xmandal_integrating_2007">32</a>]</span>), is a Ptolemy-based workflow engine,
<span class="cite">[<a 
href="#Xbrooks_triquetrum:_2015">34</a>]</span>. Several of the authors of this paper are using it to investigate these
issues.
<!--l. 532--><p class="indent" >   It is widely known that tools that make researchers more productive tend to
improve the pursuit of existing research. The high extensibility of ICE and
the tools that it combines from the larger Eclipse ecosystem have made it
possible for researchers on the development team to quickly deploy new
simulation environments for problems, such as the binder jet modeler and
reflectivity tools mentioned earlier. Other tools create with ICE may not
radically invent something new, but they tend to streamline interactions with
those tools. Many ICE users (and certainly the development team!) have
experienced improvements in software development activities because of
the tools that ICE provides or learned new technologies because access to
new tooling was a simple as installing more plugins through the Eclipse
Marketplace.

<!--l. 584--><p class="noindent" >Workflows for computational scientists in modeling and simulation differ greatly from
experimentalists or those who primarily interact with grid-based workflow
management systems. This work presented the Eclipse Integrated Computational
Environment (ICE) and described how its has been used to address interdisciplinary
problems in modeling and simulation for energy science. One interesting avenue for
future exploration is coupling or integrating ICE with other workflow tools such as
Aiida, Triquetrum, Kepler and Pegasus. It remains as abundantly clear now as it was
in Mandal&#8217;s 2007 paper that the best of all workflow management tools will be
needed to address high-performance computing problems at the exascale and
beyond.

<!--l. 3--><p class="noindent" >The previous review of workflows and workflow management systems as well as the
discussion of Eclipse ICE illustrated the diverse nature of scientific workflows. There
are many problems that arise from this diversity the community would stand to
benefit if they could be addressed. However, it should be clear from the previous
sections that there are two significant problems facing the workflow science
community:
     <ul class="itemize1">
     <li class="itemize">Everyone has their own workflow tools, and no two tool chains are the
     same.
     </li>
     <li class="itemize">There is very little interoperability in the workflow tool space.</li></ul>
<!--l. 14--><p class="indent" >   The following sections elaborate on community drivers for providing
interoperability between workflow management systems.
   <h3 class="sectionHead"><span class="titlemark">4.1   </span> <a 
 id="x1-310004.1"></a>A Buildings Block Approach</h3>
<!--l. 19--><p class="noindent" >For many reasons, the traditional approach for building workflow systems has been to
build as much of the required capability as possible into the system itself, relying
very little on external services or even third party code. This does not track will with
the course of history since high-level functionality tends to slowly creep down the
software stack and into kernels, kernel services, and system libraries. Jha and Turilli
discuss this trend as it relates to workflows from a cyber infrastructure perspective
and to existing large scale scientific workflow efforts, <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#Xjha_building_2016">13</a>]</span>. They propose that, while
historically successful, monolithic workflow systems present many problems for users,
developers, and maintainers. Instead, they propose that a new &#8220;Lego style&#8221; approach
might work better where individual &#8220;building blocks&#8221; of capability are assembled into
the final workflow product. These building blocks would include things like
programming interfaces to queuing systems, programmable pilot systems for
scheduling jobs, workload balancers, and ensemble execution tools, among
others.
<!--l. 36--><p class="indent" >   This approach would greatly improve both interoperability and sustainability
because it would standardize the programming interfaces and backends used by
workflow management systems. Jha et al. are developing a white paper to address
this further, <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#Xjha_towards_2016">37</a>]</span>.

<!--l. 44--><p class="noindent" >Session IV of the Twentieth Anniversary Meeting of the SOS Workshop (SOS20)
focused on workflow and workflow management system development activities of the
three participating institutions: Sandia National Laboratory, Oak Ridge National
Laboratory, and the Swiss National Supercomputing Centre, <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#Xpack_sos20_2016">38</a>]</span>. Multiple presenters
illustrated the challenges facing the workflow science community and organized a
                                                                  

                                                                  
separate, spontaneous &#8220;Birds of a Feather&#8221; (BOF) session at the end of the event.
The BOF attendees widely agreed after a thorough discussion that no one single
workflow management system could satisfy all the needs of those present, but
that the community as a whole would be served best by seeking to enable
interoperability where possible. This discussion led to a wider engagement of
the community by BOF attendees who decided that it would be best to
engage in an open public forum so that other groups could join the effort,

<!--l. 61--><p class="noindent" >The large number of workflow management systems and lack of interoperability is a
significant barrier to their adoption in high-performance computing facilities such as
the U.S. Department of Energy&#8217;s Leadership Computing Facilities. The high
performance computing Facility Operational Assessment 2015: Oak Ridge Leadership
Computing Facility report, <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#Xbarker_scientific_2007">12</a>]</span>, illustrates the problem that such facilities
face,
<!--l. 70--><p class="indent" >
     <!--l. 70--><p class="noindent" >These   discussions   concluded   with   the   observation   that   the
     current proliferation of workflow systems in response to perceived
     domain-specific  needs  of  scientific  workflows  makes  it  difficult  to
     choose a site-wide operational workflow manager, particularly for
     the  leadership-class  machines.  However,  there  are  opportunities
     where  facilities  can  centralize  workflow  technology  offerings  to
     reduce  anticipated  fragmentation.  This  is  especially  true  if  a
     facility attempts to develop, deploy, and operate each and every
     workflow solution requested by the user community. Through these
     evaluations, the OLCF seeks to identify interesting intersections that
     are of the most value to OLCF stakeholders.
<!--l. 82--><p class="indent" >   The Oak Ridge Leadership Computing Facility (OLCF) is not alone in this as
other Leadership Computing Facilities face the same problem. Few of these
facilities have discussed the possibility they may end up supporting different
workflows systems entirely such that workflows at one facility can not be run at
another without significant work to install an additional workflow management
system!
<!--l. 89--><p class="indent" >   Developing interoperability layers based on common building blocks with
standard service interfaces would address both of these problems by allowing facilities
to run various workflows on the system that worked best for their hardware and
software configuration.

<!--l. 96--><p class="noindent" >The Future of Scientific Workflows report by Deelman et al. illustrates the idea of the
&#8220;large-scale science campaign,&#8221; <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#Xdeelman_future_2015">15</a>]</span>. Such a campaign integrates multiple workflows
to perform data acquisition from experimental equipment, modeling and
analysis with supercomputers, and data analysis with either grids computing or
supercomputers. This is, in essence, the same problem that PanDA/BigPanDA solves
for the Large Hadron Collider. So, while it is not a new problem, it is increasingly
common. One solution to this problem is to support all the possible workflow
management systems, but that becomes quickly unsustainable, as the OLCF learned
through experience. Enabling interoperability is a much more sustainable
solution.
<!--l. 108--><p class="indent" >   An interesting case study is the ICEMAN project at Oak Ridge National
Laboratory, on which the author is a co-principal investigator. ICEMAN seeks to use
a combination of instruments from the Spallation Neutron Source, OLCF compute
resources such as the Titan supercomputer, the Laboratory&#8217;s Compute Advanced
Data Environment for Science (CADES), Eclipse ICE, and AiiDA (c.f. - <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#Xpizzi_aiida:_2016">8</a>]</span>) to
automate the analysis of quasielastic neutron scattering data and provide a
comprehensive problem solving environment for scientists.

<!--l. 3--><p class="noindent" >This work has shown that there is significant ambiguity in the definition of &#8220;scientific
workflows&#8221; and that a pressing need exists to leverage the different types of systems
that exist to address scientific challenges. While the idea of creating a single, unifying
workflow management system that addresses all of the needs of the community is
tempting, it is likely impossible because of the diversity of the community.
On the other hand, facilitating interoperability between these systems has
been shown to work with Eclipse ICE and Triquetrum as well and with
<span class="cite">[<a 
href="#Xmandal_integrating_2007">32</a>]</span>.
<!--l. 14--><p class="indent" >   Therefore this work proposes the following tasks to
     <ol  class="enumerate1" >
     <li 
  class="enumerate" id="x1-35002x1">develop a comprehensive ontology of workflows and workflow management
     systems to show the complex relationships and similarities between the
     tools, thereby revealing the means to enable interoperability.
     </li>
     <li 
  class="enumerate" id="x1-35004x2">demonstrate the utility of this ontology by creating an interoperability
     layer between several workflow management systems using the common
     building blocks approach of Jha et al., <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#Xjha_building_2016">13</a>]</span>, language translation tools such
     as Extensible Stylesheet Language Transformations (XSLT), and other
     means as required.
     </li>
     <li 
  class="enumerate" id="x1-35006x3">deploy this layer as a common building block itself through a scalable web
     service.
     </li>
     <li 
  class="enumerate" id="x1-35008x4">demonstrate the utility of the interoperability layer by executing complex,
     multi-system workflows across hardware types for problems relevant to
     energy science, including the ICEMAN and VIBE projects.</li></ol>
<!--l. 36--><p class="indent" >   It is interesting to ask why an ontology is necessary instead of a taxonomy, a
controlled vocabulary, or another mechanism for modeling the workflow science
space. The primary benefit of an ontology over these other mechanisms is that
onotologies are neither controlled (vocabularies) nor hierarchical (taxonomies).
Ontologies show all relationships.
<!--l. 43--><p class="indent" >   Hierarchy and control constrain and bias models in unnecessary ways, especially
when the relationships between most types of information are not directed, <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#Xweinberger_everything_2008">40</a>]</span>.
Ontologies show relationships between elements without imposing order and are
much easier to extend because new elements with new characteristics do not require
modifying the architecture and layout of the taxonomy. For example, a taxonomy
would require that all workflow systems derive, ultimately, from one or more
parent workflow system types, and that the properties of each system be
drawn from one or more controlled vocabularies that are supported by the
taxonomy. This simply may not be the case and, instead, an ontology would not
impose such an organization, but produce a list of the properties of each
system and an undirected graph of the relationships between ontological
elements.
<!--l. 57--><p class="indent" >   One important thing to keep in mind about ontologies is that it is important to
                                                                  

                                                                  
describe how they map to or extend existing ontologies. There are many ways to
produce these mappings by leveraging the extensive body of literature available from
the library and informational sciences community, <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#Xallemang_semantic_2008">41</a>]</span>.
<!--l. 63--><p class="indent" >   The necessity of producing the interoperability layer as a scalable web service
cannot be overstated. All of the workflow management systems cited in this
work publish scalable web services and interact with other web services in
one or more ways. Their are several additional advantages, but perhaps the
largest is that it will make it possible for the interoperability layer itself to
be integrated as yet another workflow element in workflow management
systems.
<!--l. 71--><p class="indent" >   Producing the ontology and interoperability layer for this work will require a
survey of workflows and workflow management systems used by the community. For
the latter and for the energy science demonstrations, virtual &#8220;containers&#8221; such as
Docker will be used to work with the systems on the Compute And Data
Environment for Science at Oak Ridge National Laboratory. In addition to making it
possible to study these systems, using containers will also preserve this work for
others who may seek to reproduce it in the future.
<!--l. 80--><p class="indent" >   Because of its mature API and ability to integrate well with other workflow tools,
Eclipse ICE will be used as a test bed for developing and deploying the workflow
interoperability layer. Much like its successful &#8220;spin-offs&#8221; for data structures and
visualization, ICE can foster the development of the interoperability layer and act as
a launching platform for a service that eventually stands alone. Likewise, ICE already
contains all the necessary code to connect to common building blocks, containers,
and web services.
