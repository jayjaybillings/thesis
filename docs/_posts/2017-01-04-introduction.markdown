The study of workflows, workflow management systems, and the broader topics of
so-called "workflow science" has revolutionized the way humans automate
activities in business, science, medicine and many others fields, greatly 
improving efficiency in each. Our dependence on workflow tools and technology
is so great that some of the most common questions in technical discussions are
arguably "How do we automate that?" and "How are you going to handle your 
workflow?" Workflow tools have even "invaded" our homes by becoming so easy to
use that children can use them to clandestinely stock up on cookies, doll 
houses, and Pokemon, \[Mail Online, 2016]\[Williams, 2017]!

However, there are many unresolved problems in workflow science that will 
seriously limit the continued utility of these tools for interdisciplinary 
research. There are many practical problems, some of which are shared with
other fields, but the largest issues are those of a fundamental, theoretical 
nature that have never been investigated across the entire field. For example, 
what is a "workflow" and what is a "workflow management system?" Are workflows
in modeling and simulation the same as workflows in grid computing? Are 
scientific workflows actually the same as business workflows given the right
theoretical abstraction? There are no generally accepted answers for these 
questions and, indeed, every relevant reference for this work provided a 
different definition of a workflow, (albeit some of the definitions were 
similar). 

These basic, fundamental questions have significant implications for long-term 
sustainability, interoperability, and (workflow) reproducibility. 
Interoperability in particular is interesting because of the opportunity to
leverage existing capabilities and workflows in different systems without
reproducing either the components or the workflows in the second system. In 
practice, this is rarely possible. Few workflow systems will work together 
because most systems are developed with different or custom approaches, or, in
many cases, were never developed to be interoperable at all and there are no
obvious ways to "just make it work."

In this work, we propose that the solution to these problems stems from the
lack of a comprehensive ontology for workflow science. Specifically, we

* provide a brief literature review of workflows and efforts to develop
taxonomies (not ontologies) for workflows and workflow management systems, and
describe why a classic taxonomy may be insufficient.
* present the Eclipse Integrated Computational Environment as an appropriate
test bed for these ideas and contextualize it in the broader workflows tool 
space.
* describe challenges the workflows community is currently facing that
would be solved by the development of an ontology that facilitated 
interoperability.
* enummerate the necessary tasks and challenges of such an effort.
