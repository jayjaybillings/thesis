FIXME!
On page 750 of the paper, in their discussion about the Kepler workflow
management system, Barker and Hemert state that

```
Actors are re-usable independent blocks of computation, such as: Web Services,
database calls, etc.
```

Jha and Turilli. have proposed using independent "building blocks" as an 
approach to scientific workflows which espouses a similar relationship to 
infrastructure services, \[Jha, 2016]. The similarity is notable and the exact
relationship between Jha's blocks and Actor-Oriented Programming should be
investigated further.



### Notes

Jha worked with Barker and Hemert around the time they published their article 
as a visiting professor at the University of Edinburgh, so the similarity in 
thinking may come from their close relationship.
