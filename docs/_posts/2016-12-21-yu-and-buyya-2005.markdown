Yu's and Buyya's developed a taxonomy for workflow management systems on grids 
that sought to capture the architectural style while identifying comparison 
criteria, \[Yu, 2005]. "Grid Computing" in this sense is the integration of 
"large-scale, distributed and heterogenous resources." Their work is notable 
because it largely avoids a discussion of applications and focuses purely on 
the functional properties of the workflow management systems as they exist on
the grids. Yu and Buyya root their taxonomy on five core elements of 
grid-based workflow management systems: workflow design, information retrieval,
workflow scheduling, fault tolerance, and data movement. While many of the
properties and taxonomic elements they describe seem common to all systems,
others, such as "Workflow QoS Constraints" would appear to be grid-specific at
present. Their work also shows how thirteen common grid workflow management 
systems, such as Pegasus and Kepler, are covered by the taxonomy.
