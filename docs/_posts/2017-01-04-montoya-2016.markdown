Montoya et al. discuss workflows needs for the Alliance for Application 
Performance at Extreme Scale (APEX), \[APEX, 2017], and describe three main
classes of workflows: Simulation Science, Uncertainty Quantification (UQ), and
High Throughput Computing (HTC), \[Montoya, 2016]. HTC workflows start with the
collection of data from experiments that is in turn transported to large
compute facilities for processing. Many grid workflows are HTC workflows, but
not all HTC workflows are grid workflows since some HTC workflows, such as
those those presented by Montoya et al., maybe be run on large resources that
are not traditionally "grid machines." Simulation science workflows, referred
to above as modeling and simulation workflows, are those workflows that are
primarily focused on modeling and simulation activities. UQ workflows build on
modeling and simulation workflows by, essentially, executing ensembles of jobs
or ensembles of whole workflows to quantify uncertainty in simulation results.
Montoya et al. also provide a detailed mapping of each workflow type to optimal
hardware resources for the APEX program.
